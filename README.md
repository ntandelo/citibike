# CitiBike Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this presentation, we will attempt to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. This will be done by analyzing data from New York City's CitiBike share program. 

## Analysis Types
This analysis was performed using the following metrics:
* Show amount of bike repairs, and most popular riding months
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
* Dispay all visualizations in a Tableau Presentation (linked below) to really wow investors.
